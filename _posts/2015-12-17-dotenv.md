In your node projects, tired of fooling with your Terminal to set your local environment variables?

Try the dotenv package.

###1.
Navigate, using your terminal, to the root directory of your project

###2.
Type the following

        npm install dotenv --save
        
###3.
Navigate to your startup file... ie, whatever file you use when you type `node app.js`, or `node server.js`

Type

        touch .env
        
so that the .env file will be in the same folder as your startup file

###3.
You now have a .env file. Add it to your .gitignore file like so,

        /.env

otherwise you will upload it to github, which would put all your secrets info out in public.
 
###4.
In your .env file, put your secret information like so. Note that quotes are not necessary.

        DB_USER=whatever
        DB_PASS=whatever
        DB_HOST=ds000000.mongolab.com:0000/whatever
        SUPERSECRET=987df87d9f87g9d8f7g98ds7f9g

###5.
Add this line as early as possible to your main startup file.

    `require('dotenv').load();`

Then, after you reboot your server, you can access those secret variables in your code like so

        // server.js
        var superSecret = process.env.SUPERSECRET;
        var mongoAddress = 'mongodb://'+
            process.env.DB_USER+':'+
            process.env.DB_PASS+'@'+
            process.env.DB_HOST;
        mongoose.connect(mongoAddress);
